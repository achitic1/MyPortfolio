        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am a computer science student at the University of Maryland and I expect to graduate in May 2025. My interests are 
            in software and game development. I am someone who is fascinated by technology and I am eager to continue learning 
            every day. I like to embrace a challenge and use it as an opportunity to learn and grow as a person and professional. 
            I hope that my work throughout my career will impact the world in a positive way. <br><br>
            I've always loved playing video games. I grew up playing a lot of Pokemon and Super Mario on my Gameboy. I also played a lot of Playstation.
            Outside of video games I also like board games, watching sports and movies with friends and family. I'm someone who gets into
            different hobbies quite frequently. I'd say its because of the excitement that comes with learning new skills whether it be practical or just for fun.

        <p>Project: Regular Expressions Engine<br>
           Description: Implemented algorithms for working with Non-deterministic Finite Automata (NFAs),
           Deterministic Finite Automata (DFAs), and regular expressions.
           Developed functions for NFA to DFA conversion, move and epsilon closure operations, and constructed NFAs from regular expressions.</p>
